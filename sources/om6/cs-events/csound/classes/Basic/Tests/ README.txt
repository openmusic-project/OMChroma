;		CSOUND SCORES FOR TESTING
;=========================================================================
;	SIMPLE PRE-DEFINED MONO INSTRUMENTS AND CLASSES
;	COVERING MOST OF THE SIGNAL-PROCESSING BASED SYNTHESIS TECHNIQUES
;	SOME FILES ARE BASED ON THE AMSTERDAM CATALOGUE OF CSOUND INSTRUMENTS
;	   SIMULATING JEAN-CLAUDE RISSET'S INSTRUMENTS WHEN POSSIBLE
;	OTHERS ARE SIMPLE INSTRUMENTS MADE BY MYSELF
;
;	ALL THE ORCHESTRAS SHARE A COMMON DESIGN

; SEE THE FILES Doc-Chroma-Slots AND Doc-Chroma-Classes in
;	Chromawk/in-files/Data
;	FOR A DETAILED DESCRICTION OF EACH ORCHESTRA/LISP CLASS

;IMPORTANT REMARK: TO TEST A GIVEN ORCHESTRA, DO:
; a) COPY THE ORCHESTRA FROM THE MAIN DIRECTORY INTO THIS "Tests" DIRECTORY
; b) OPEN A TERMINAL WINDOW AND TYPE my-computer>cd <this-directory>
; c) TYPE: my-computer> ./run-cs <name_without_extension>

; MAKE SURE THAT THE FILES NEEDED BY FILE-READING ORCHESTRAS (smpl, fog, etc.)
;    ARE PLACED IN THIS DIRECTORY (THEY SHOULD BE)
; MAKE SURE THAT CSOUND IS CORRECTLY INSTALLED IN /usr/loca/bin
; A SOUND FILE NAMED "name.aif" WILL BE CREATED IN THIS DIRECTORY

; A COPY OF THE "run-cs" SCRIPT IS IN THE FOLDER "scripts"
; IN CASE AN ORCHESTRA OR SCORE FILES LOOK STRANGE WHEN SEEING THEM
;   (>more <name.orc>), IT IS POSSIBLY DUE TO A PROBLEM WITH CRLF
; IN THIS CASE, RUN THE SCRIPT "convert" IN THE FOLDER "scripts"
;   OR OPEN THE FILE WITH TEXTWRANGLER AND MAKE SURE THAT Unix (LF)
;   IS SELECTED
